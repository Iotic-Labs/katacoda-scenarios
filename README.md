### Running scenario examples in Python shell

In order run the example code in the Python shell, as opposed to the default shell, there is `install-sdk.sh` _foreground script_ which runs `python -i /tmp/init.py`.

This runs the `init.py` (a scenario asset) which installs dependencies in Python and keeps the Python interactive shell open.

### Scenario Dependencies - Assets

We would prefer to provide a pre-built Docker image with all the dependencies.

But it's not currently possible to use custom environment images for Katacoda scenarios.
See <https://www.katacoda.community/environments.html>

Therefore the dependencies are configured via [assets](https://www.katacoda.community/customizing-environment.html#uploading-files).

Iotics is in the process to open-source the `iotics-lib-identity` Python package and publish it to [pypi](https://pypi.org/). But until that is done, there is a workaround in place. The package is embedded in the scenario as an asset and `install-sdk.sh` _foreground script_ waits for the assets to be uploaded and `init.py` then installs the package and other Python dependencies.
