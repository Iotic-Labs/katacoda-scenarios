# Introduction to IOTICS using spacectl
This scenario will get you started on your IOTICS journey.

IOTICS is all about data interactions, when data is shared and exchanged across applications and even the boundaries of enterprises and industries.

We believe data interactions should be:

* secure and transparent
* across any format
* available anywhere

IOTICS enables this connected world through the use of Digital Twins.

Digital Twins are digital copies of physical assets, each with their own configurable and updatable metadata. They can also have feeds for when a feed of data is more appropriate. All of these twins exist within an IOTICSpace.

IOTICSpace allows you to simplify and coordinate this data, creating an ecosystem of data interactions internally, or externally of your enterprise.

This tutorial will take you through the creation of your first Digital Twin.

By the end of this tutorial you’ll be able to:

* Create a model of a Digital Twin
* Create Digital Twin
* Find a Digital Twin
* Follow a Digital Twin
* View the data from a Digital Twin
