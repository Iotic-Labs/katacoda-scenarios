We use a delegation model whereby _Agents_ are delegated to act on behalf of _Users_. The delegation permission is granted by the _User_ itself and the delegation record is written in the _Agent_ DID.

`user_id=$(create_user_id $user_seed)`{{execute}}

`echo $user_id`{{execute}}

You've just created your first secure decentralised identity, great job!
